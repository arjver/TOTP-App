# TOTP[App]
### Open Source TOTP authenticator with E2EE self-hostable sync

Goal: a free, open-source, cross-platform, authenticator app that supports end-to-end encrypted sync.

<!-- Currently in **Alpha**. Barely functional. Has bugs and missing features. Use at your own risk, and back up your tokens. -->

Currently in **beta**, use at your own risk and back up your tokens.

Why: there don't seem to be any free, open-source, non-self hosted authenticators with E2EE sync, for some reason

- **GUI** (svelte SPA/offline-capable PWA): close to functional
- core library (TS): done
- remote (cloudflare workers): done
- CLI: coming soon(-ish)

# Usage
Easiest: [Go to the live, static web app, hosted on Cloudflare Pages.](https://totp-app.pages.dev/) It is a fully offline capable PWA, and can be "installed" through your browser.

Apps for iOS and Android are coming soon.

You can also self-host the `app/dist` directory, which contains the same site deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

By default, it uses Cloudflare Workers to sync data across devices.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not responsible or liable for any data loss, security issues, etc. that arise from your use of this app. Use at your own risk, especially while this is in beta. I've tried not to leave major security vulnerabilities but obviously can't guarantee that.

## Self-hosted sync
*Not yet supported in the GUI App, coming soon.*
The `remote` directory contains an npm project for a cloudflare worker. To run it locally you can run `npm i` and `npm run start` in the `remote` directory. (This uses `miniflare` and `workersd`).
